# Azure Policy Definition module

## Overview

The BBL Policy Definition module creates one Azure Policy definition by parsing the `*.json` file referenced in the folder `/policy_definitions/` (or sub-folder). The `JSON` file contains the Azure Policy Definition.

Azure Policy helps to enforce organizational standards and to assess compliance at-scale. Through its [compliance dashboard](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyMenuBlade/Compliance), it provides an aggregated view to evaluate the overall state of the environment, with the ability to drill down to the per-resource, per-policy granularity. It also helps to bring resources to compliance through bulk remediation for existing resources and automatic remediation for new resources.

## Notes

- This module is designed to parse the [JSON Azure policy definition structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure#avoiding-template-failures). Another structure will result in creation errors,
- The resulting created Azure Policy Definitions can be found in the [Azure Policy | Definitions](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyMenuBlade/Definitions) blade,
- The RBAC Roles required to interact with Azure Policy Definitions are:

  - The `Resource Policy Contributor` role is required and it includes most Azure Policy operations,
  - The `Owner` role has full rights to perform all activities on the policy definitions and assignments,
  - Both the `Contributor` and `Reader` roles have access to all read Azure Policy operations only. It is important to note that `Contributor` may trigger resource remediation, but can't create definitions or assignments,
  - The RBAC role of `User Access Administrator` is necessary to grant the managed identity on deployIfNotExists or modify assignments necessary permissions,
  - All policy objects will be readable to all roles over the scope.

- All **created** Azure Policies definitions must be declared of type `Custom` (case sensitive), in the JSON node `properties.policyType`. The module enforces this,

- To create a Policy Definition with the module, set:
  - the `policyDefinitionJsonFile`:
    - give the name of the Policy Assignment JSON file to use,
    - the module assumes all the `JSON` files are stored in a folder at the root of the module named `/policy_definitions/`,
    - the folder can contain sub folders. In that case the filename value should match this structure: `sub/policy_definition1.json`,
  - To create the Policy Definition at a Management group level, the variable `management_group_id` must be set. If using `azurerm_management_group` block to set this variable, be sure to use `name` or `group_id`, but not `id`.
  - Without further inputs, the JSON content is used to create the Policy Definition,
  - It is possible to override the JSON values by declaring values for these variables:

```yaml
        name
        display_name
        description
        mode
```

- There's a maximum count for each object type for Azure Policy:
  - For definitions, an entry of _Scope_ means the `management group` or `subscription`,
  - For assignments and exemptions, an entry of _Scope_ means the `management group`, `subscription`, `resource group`, or individual `resource`,
  - More information: [Maximum count of Azure Policy objects](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview#maximum-count-of-azure-policy-objects).

## Example

```yaml
#-------------------------------------------
#    Policy Definition module
#------------------------------------------
module "BBL-policy-definition" {

   source = "../../terraform-azurerm-policydefinition"
  # Required variable
  policyDefinitionJsonFile = "Resource_Group_Tags.json"

  # Optional variables
  name                = "Resource_Group_Tags_mgmt"
  display_name        = "Resource_Group_Tags_mgmt"
  # description         = null
  # mode                = null
  management_group_id = "test"
}
```

Note: For the example to work locally, a replacement is required in the line 17 of `main.tf`: `${path.root}` must be replaced by `${path.module}`.
